##################################################
#Purpose:
#	Provide an automated script to start the 
#	netcap client process.
#Developer:
#	Ray Daley
#Notes:
#	- This script is intended to be used with 
#	the netcap program.
#	- You may need to set the path for the 
#	bash interpreter above if it is different 
#	then: "/bin/bash"
#
#	Passing certain options/arguments where 
#	quotes are necessary, you may receive a 
#	conflict. This is due to the shell trying
#	to parse the value. 
#
#	Note: This is only the case when passed via the script, 
#	not when passed using the command line
#
#	For example:
#
#	NETCAP_ARG="... -gd fetch='GEO_LOC_INFO|GEO_IP4_INFO' ..."
#	
#	The above will result in a misleading error:
#
#	ERROR: Invalid destination geo constant or combination. \
#	Expecting: GEO_LOC_INFO or GEO_IP4_INFO
#	Unable to start netcap client. Aborting.	
#
#	The above can be addressed by specifiying it as follows:
#
#	NETCAP_ARG="... -gd fetch='"GEO_LOC_INFO|GEO_IP4_INFO"' ..."
#		- OR -
#	NETCAP_ARG="... -gd fetch="'GEO_LOC_INFO|GEO_IP4_INFO'" ..."
#
#	This allows the shell to parse appropriately.
